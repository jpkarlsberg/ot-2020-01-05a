<p>The authors of Original Sacred Harp&rsquo;s preface contrast the book&rsquo;s &ldquo;sacred tunes&rdquo; with other music genres, revealing anxieties about the New South&rsquo;s racial and cultural politics. In rejecting "secular" music, the authors emphasized the tunebook&rsquo;s religious purposes, contrasting its repertoire with contemporaneous secular music. In dismissing &ldquo;operatic&rdquo; sounds, the Original Sacred Harp editors distanced the tunebook from the performative singing styles popular in elite urban churches that were influenced by the annual Atlanta performances of the New York Metropolitan Opera. By distinguishing the book&rsquo;s music from "rag-time," a term connoting the syncopated dance music of African Americans, as well as the ostensibly similar rhythms of contemporaneous white gospel music, the editors distanced themselves and <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>&rsquo;s music from both black cultural affiliation. Like rag-time, "jig" may have connoted a frivolity incompatible with the editors&rsquo; desired religious fervor, while carrying similar associations with blackness and immigrant populations not yet recognized as white.</p>
