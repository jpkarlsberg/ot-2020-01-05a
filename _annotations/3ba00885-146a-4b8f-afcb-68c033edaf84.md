<p>In contrast to the <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> editors&rsquo; preferred musically conservative style, early twentieth-century sacred vocal music was embracing striking new harmonies produced by chromatic motion and consecutive dominant seventh chords following circle-of-fifths progressions. With roots in black quartet singing, blackface minstrelsy, and European tonal harmony, these sounds contributed to secular genres such as ragtime and barbershop, later emerging in gospel music and hymn arrangements. <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>&rsquo;s editors sought to champion an alternative modernity, distinct from such recent innovations in sacred song.</p>
