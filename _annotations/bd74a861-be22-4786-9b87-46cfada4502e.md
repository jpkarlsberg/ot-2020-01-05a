<p>J. S. James retained this statement even after his discovery of an attribution to "Hitchcock" in an earlier source prompted the modification of this page's printing plate to include the new attribution in a later printing of <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>. The contradiction that resulted from this retention points to the hastiness of the tunebook&rsquo;s editorial process during its revision post-publication.</p>
