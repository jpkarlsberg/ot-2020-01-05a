<p>James adopts a moderate if haphazard approach to the evolving spellings of shape-note syllables at the time. Here, he retains the spelling of &ldquo;Faw" from <em>The Sacred Harp</em>&rsquo;s nineteenth-century rudiments even though he spells the note &ldquo;Fa&rdquo; in the seven-note scale on this page and in the four-note scales on pages 2 and 3 of the <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> rudiments {related pages: pp. 2 and 3}. In contrast, James employs the conventional spellings of &ldquo;La&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mi&rdquo; here for both the four- and seven-note scales, departing from both previous rudiments and his own diagram on page 3 that adopts the spellings &ldquo;Law&rdquo; and &ldquo;Me&rdquo; to correspond with the notes&rsquo; pronunciation.</p>
