<p>Musical editor S. M. Denson, credited here as lead writer of &ldquo;The Great Roll-Call,&rdquo; wrote six gospel songs that appeared in J. S. James&rsquo;s books. Although five of these gospel songs appeared in James&rsquo;s <em>Union Harp and History of Songs</em> (1909), for which Denson also served as musical editor, only this one appears in <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>. This editorial choice underscores James&rsquo;s commitment to <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>&rsquo;s musical conservatism and his relatively permissive approach to <em>Union Harp</em>.</p>
