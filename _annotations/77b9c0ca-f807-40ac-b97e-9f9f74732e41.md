<p>J. S. James carried over this 2sol note from nineteenth-century editions of <em>The Sacred Harp</em> (1844&ndash;70). Making an awkward leap from its preceding tone and forming a discordant interval with the other three parts, the retention of this error demonstrates the extent to which <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> editors avoided altering their source material, even when it was visibly incorrect. This reticence might be attributed to a hasty editorial process, but was also in alignment with the editors&rsquo; musical conservatism. The note was later corrected to the 5sol by editors of the 1966 edition of <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>.</p>
