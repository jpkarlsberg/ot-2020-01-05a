<p>&ldquo;The Great Roll-Call&rdquo; was first published in J. S. James&rsquo;s <em>Union Harp and History of Songs</em> (1909). As a gospel-style composition, the song stands out among the more musically conservative <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>. The song&rsquo;s placement in the rudiments represents a departure from its original location in the body of James&rsquo;s <em>Union Harp</em>, perhaps in tacit acknowledgment of its stylistic exceptionality.</p>
<p>When laying out &ldquo;The Great Roll-Call&rdquo; for <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>, James reused the song&rsquo;s original electrotyped plates, as evidenced by the score&rsquo;s compactness, designed to fit the <em>Union Harp</em>&rsquo;s shorter page height, and evidence of a previous page number (top left). The tunebook&rsquo;s printers modified the plates to add this title text, as well as a new page number in different typeface.</p>
