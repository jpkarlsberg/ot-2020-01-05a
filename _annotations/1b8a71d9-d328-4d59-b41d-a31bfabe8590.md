<p>Louis Charles Elson&rsquo;s <em>Elson's Music Dictionary</em> (1905) and J. A. Fuller Maitland and George Grove&rsquo;s <em>A Dictionary of Music and Musicians</em> (1904&ndash;10) were the reference works of record for early twentieth-century scholars and practitioners. In naming these texts, James associates <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> with a scholarly framework absent from the nineteenth-century <em>Sacred Harp</em> (1844&ndash;70) rudiments, which relied largely on other tunebook sources. Replacing these historical sources with James viewed as authoritative substitutes tied the <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> and its singers to the urban centers of European and American music from which <em>Elson's</em> and Grove's emerged.</p>
