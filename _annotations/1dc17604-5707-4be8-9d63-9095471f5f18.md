<p>The writers point to <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>&rsquo;s notation system and use of "dispersed harmony" in differentiating the book&rsquo;s &ldquo;standard living hymns&rdquo; from developments of &ldquo;the last decade.&rdquo; In a 1920 pamphlet, J. S. James defined &ldquo;dispersed harmony&rdquo; as the sounds produced when &ldquo;the notes forming the various chords [are] separated from each other by wide intervals.&rdquo; These harmonic features distinguish <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> from both the contemporaneous sacred and secular music the preface denigrates, and also from much of the &ldquo;close harmony&rdquo; reformed hymnody and early gospel music published during the second half of the nineteenth century&mdash;music that James included in his <em>Union Harp and History of Songs</em> (1909) but largely excluded from <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>.</p>
