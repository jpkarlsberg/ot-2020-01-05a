<p>This romantic account of F. F. Chopin&rsquo;s death became a favorite anecdote shared among Sacred Harp singers who encountered the tunebook during the second half of the twentieth century in choral or folk music settings. Newcomers&rsquo; amused responses to J. S. James's historical notes were perceived as condescending to some longtime singers and contributed to the decision to remove James&rsquo;s historical notes from <em>The Sacred Harp: 1991 Edition</em>.</p>
