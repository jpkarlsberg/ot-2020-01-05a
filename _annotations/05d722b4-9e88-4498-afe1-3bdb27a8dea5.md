<p>Six pages into his rudiments, J. S. James begins a numbered series of lessons, a feature he transferred from his <em>Union Harp and History of Songs</em> (1909). Although unorthodox in their placement midway through the pedagogical text, the lessons nonetheless point to a thoughtful design featuring numbered sequences of questions and answers that would be useful in a variety of teaching contexts. Many of these questions and answers are drawn without attribution from music dictionaries and encyclopedias, pedagogical texts, and essays on music appreciation. The variety of sources marks a departure from the rudiments in <em>The Sacred Harp</em>&rsquo;s nineteenth-century editions (1844&ndash;70), which drew principally on the pedagogical sections of earlier tunebooks. In both structure and sources, these ten lessons point to James&rsquo;s effort to &ldquo;get at all material modern improvement.&rdquo;</p>
