<p>As practicing lawyer and former judge of the North Georgia inferior court, J. S. James was well-positioned to investigate the copyright status of Jesse B. Aikin's seven-note system. Despite James&rsquo;s claim to the contrary, historical evidence suggests that Aikin did indeed obtain a patent for his system, leading other nineteenth-century tunebook compilers to devise their own seven-shape systems that would not infringe on his copyright.</p>
