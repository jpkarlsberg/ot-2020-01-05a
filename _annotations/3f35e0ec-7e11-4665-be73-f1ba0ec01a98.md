<p>J. S. James&rsquo;s biographies of Thomas Ken and Guillaume Franc narratively connect <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> to renowned European figures and places. James paints a compelling picture of the hymn writers and religious leaders of &ldquo;Christendom,&rdquo; but the devil lies in his incorrect details. Although Ken wrote the text most frequently paired with this tune&mdash;&ldquo;Praise God from whom all blessings flow&rdquo;&mdash;that lyric does not appear here. &ldquo;Old Hundred&rdquo; was itself added to the Genevan Psalter in 1551 after the period during which Guillaume Franc was contributing to it. Yet biographies of these figures advance James&rsquo;s effort to elevate the status of Sacred Harp singing by associating the tunebook with these leading European and Christian figures.&nbsp;</p>
