<p>S. M. Denson borrowed heavily from available tunebooks to add alto parts to hundreds of formerly three-part songs. These &ldquo;new&rdquo; alto parts were J. S. James&rsquo;s major concession to modern musical conventions. Across <em>Original Sacred Harp</em>, Denson included alto parts copied verbatim from other sources, sometimes altering the part slightly. Denson also composed new alto parts and, on rare occasions, stitched together elements from multiple sources into alto lines credited to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two natural signs are Denson&rsquo;s only deviations from the alto part for &ldquo;Fairfield&rdquo; as printed in William Walker&rsquo;s <em>The Christian Harmony</em> (1873). Denson replaced the accidental sharp and natural sign printed in <em>The Christian Harmony</em> with two (redundant) natural signs. Aware of the sign&rsquo;s redundancy&mdash;the A minor key signature contains no sharps or flats for the natural sign to nullify&mdash;the editors of <em>Original Sacred Harp: Denson Revision</em> (1936) removed as much of the natural signs as possible from the original plates. The errors were removed completely when the tunebook was digitally retypeset for <em>The Sacred Harp: 1991 Edition</em>.</p>
