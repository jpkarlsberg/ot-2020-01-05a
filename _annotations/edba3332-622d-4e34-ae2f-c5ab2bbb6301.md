<p>The editors&rsquo; suspicion of swirling vocal movements may represent a distancing of <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> from black music making. Musicologist Gage Averill describes "snaking" as the practice of "moving from one chord to another by changing one or more non-melody notes&rdquo; sometimes associated with early black quartet singing. The characterization &ldquo;rills and frills" gives the impression that the <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> editors regarded such vocal moves as frivolous in addition to "unnatural."</p>
