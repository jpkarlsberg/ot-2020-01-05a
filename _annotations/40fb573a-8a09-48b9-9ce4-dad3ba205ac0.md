<p><em>Sacred Harp</em> compiler B. F. White included &ldquo;Mear&rdquo; in the 1844 first edition of <em>The Sacred Harp</em> and made no changes to the song in subsequent editions. J. S. James&rsquo;s inaccurate statement to the contrary is remarkably specific, consistent with attributions elsewhere in <em>Original Sacred Harp</em> where James arbitrarily selected a date of composition a couple of years off from the publication date of an edition of <em>The Sacred Harp</em>. James&rsquo;s claim here may represent an attempt to exaggerate White&rsquo;s role in shaping the tunebook&rsquo;s contents and it contributes to James&rsquo;s goal of binding White and the tunebook more closely to the distant and prestigious people, places, and times associated with &ldquo;Mear.&rdquo;</p>
